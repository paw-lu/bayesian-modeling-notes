# Joint and conditional probability

If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then

$$
P(A, B) = P(A) P(B)
$$

This is not often the case.

Can think of this and an $AND$ condition.
The probability of $A$ $AND$ $B$ is the probability of $A$ multiplied by the probability of $B$.

$P(A | B)$ is the probability that some $A$
knowing that some other $B$ is true.

$$
P(A, B)=P(A \mid B) P(B)
$$

$$
P(B \mid A)=\frac{P(A \mid B) P(B)}{P(A)}
$$
